# dnsgo-traffic-analysis
Tools for analyzing PCAP files to identify DNS queries with high latency written in [go](https://go.dev/)

# Overview
Clients frequently ask engineers to identify slow DNS queries in response to customer complaints about resolution issues. This often results in lengthy troubleshooting sessions using tools like tcpdump and Wireshark, along with extended customer interactions. The following tools can help streamline the investigation process and provide detailed reports directly from the CLI, reducing time spent on diagnostics.

Inspred by [dns-traffic-analysis](https://github.com/mragusa/dns-traffic-analysis) but written in go

* traffic-analyzer
  - read a pcap file and report on dns queries slower than the specified time duration
  - writes total queries and slow queries found to files for review
  - imports pprof module for deeper dive into application internals
  - capable of reading 1G pcap files in under 90 seconds
* packet-reader
  - reads pcap file and displays DNS packet content to stdout

## Requirements
  - [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) version 1.22 or higher
  - [gopacket](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/gopacket)

## Build Instructions
1. **Clone repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/mragusa/dnsgo-traffic-analysis.git
```
2. **Install modules**
```
go mod init gopacket
go mod tidy
```
3. **Build binary**
```
cd traffic-analyzer  && go build traffic-analyzer.go
```
